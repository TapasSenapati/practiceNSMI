    "text": "What does a 'Normal' shape of term structure indicate?",
    "options": [
      "It indicates that the rate is same for all terms",
      "It indicates that the rate rises with the term",
      "It indicates that the rate falls with the term",
      "It indicates that the rate first rises and then falls with the term"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The \"Normal\" shape of the term structure of interest rates (or yield curve) is upward sloping, meaning longer-term bonds have higher yields than shorter-term bonds. This reflects expectations of economic growth, inflation, and the time value of money. A normal or upward-sloping yield curve indicates that longer-term interest rates are higher than shorter-term rates. This is considered \"normal\" because investors typically demand a premium for lending their money over longer periods, due to increased risk and opportunity costs. &nbsp;"

      "Nominal rate plus effective rate",
      "Nominal interest rate less inflation",
      "Nominal rate plus inflation",
      "Inflation less nominal rate"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The real interest rate represents the actual purchasing power of interest earnings, after adjusting for inflation. The approximate formula for calculating the real interest rate is: Real Interest Rate ≈ Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate &nbsp;"

      "20",
      "25",
      "30"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The Core SGF (Settlement Guarantee Fund) is a dedicated fund to ensure settlement obligations are met in case of a default, and stock exchanges are required to contribute at least 25% of the MRC to this fund. This is outlined in SEBI's guidelines, which specify that the Clearing Corporation contributes at least 50% of the MRC, the Stock Exchange contributes at least 25%, and the remaining up to 25% can come from Clearing Members. &nbsp;"

      "Theta",
      "Gamma",
      "Rho",
      "Delta"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Theta is a measure of an option’s sensitivity to time decay. Theta is the change in option price given a one-day decrease in time to expiration. It is a measure of time decay. Theta is generally used to gain an idea of how time decay is affecting your option positions. &nbsp;"

      "Notional Value"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Intrinsic Value represents the amount by which an option is in the money (ITM)—meaning the difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset. -&nbsp;For a call option, it's the current price of the underlying asset minus the strike price (if positive). -&nbsp;For a put option, it's the strike price minus the current price of the underlying asset (if positive). &nbsp;"

      "Buy GOI Bond Call option",
      "Sell GOI Bond futures",
      "Both of the above",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: If a person expects interest rates to rise in the future: Bond prices fall when interest rates rise (they have an inverse relationship). So, to hedge against rising interest rates, the person should take a position that profits when bond prices fall. Sell Govt Of India bond futures &nbsp;- This is a hedge against falling bond prices (i.e., rising interest rates). If interest rates go up, bond prices drop, and the short futures position makes a profit, offsetting losses elsewhere. &nbsp;"

      "Rs. 19,90,000"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The Lot size for bond futures is 2000 Lots purchased = 10 Price = Rs 99 Therefore the contract value = 2000 x 10 x 99 = Rs 19,80,000 &nbsp;"

      "Treasury Bills futures",
      "10 year Government Bond futures",
      "Both of these",
      "None of these"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: 10-year Government Bond Futures contracts are directly linked to the price of long-term Government of India bonds (typically with a maturity around 10 years). Since bond prices have an inverse relationship with interest rates, these futures allow you to take a position on the expected direction of long-term interest rates. If you expect long-term rates to fall (bond prices to rise), you would buy the futures. If you expect long-term rates to rise (bond prices to fall), you would sell the futures. Treasury bills are short-term debt instruments and are not the ideal instrument for speculating or hedging for long-term interest rate movement. &nbsp;"

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Under the SEBI SCORES 2.0 framework, when a person lodges a complaint against a SEBI-registered entity, the complaint is automatically forwarded to the concerned entity. The entity is then required to respond and submit an Action Taken Report (ATR) on the SCORES platform within 21 calendar days of receiving the complaint. If the entity fails to respond within this timeframe or the investor is not satisfied with the response, the complaint is escalated to a first-level review with a designated body. &nbsp;"

      "Compounding frequency",
      "Both - Identities of debtor and lender and Compounding frequency"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Day Count Basis is essential because it defines how time is measured in the interest calculation — for example: Actual/360 30/360 Actual/Actual These conventions determine how the number of days in the interest period is counted, which directly affects the final interest amount. &nbsp;"

      "Both of the above",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A person who holds a fixed income security (like a bond) is exposed to interest rate risk — specifically, the risk that interest rates may rise, which would decrease the price of the bond. To hedge this risk, the person can sell GOI bond futures Thus, if interest rates rise, bond prices fall. By selling bond futures, the person profits from the drop in futures prices, which offsets the loss in the value of the bond. &nbsp;"

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: All of the options listed are interest rate derivatives, which are financial instruments used to manage or hedge interest rate risk.&nbsp; Forward Rate Agreement (FRA): A contract between two parties to fix the interest rate for a future period, used to hedge against interest rate fluctuations. Interest Rate Swaps: A contract where two parties exchange cash flows based on different interest rates, typically one fixed and one floating, to manage interest rate exposure.
