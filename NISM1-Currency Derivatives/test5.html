    "explanation": "Explanation: A long put option is a bearish trade that profits when the spot price falls. Once the breakeven point is achieved, the trader is already in profit. Therefore, if the spot price rises (moves against the initial bearish expectation), the option's value and the trade's overall profitability will decrease. Profitability only continues to increase if the spot price continues to fall. A long put option lets you sell the asset at the strike price. After the breakeven point (Strike − Premium), if the spot price rises, the difference between strike and spot shrinks, so the option becomes less profitable. &nbsp;"

Payment Delay: They receive USD from exports and have to pay for imports seven days later. Here's how this impacts currency risk: -&nbsp;If the INR appreciates against the USD during those seven days, the company will receive fewer INR for their USD exports and pay more INR for their USD imports. -&nbsp;If the INR depreciates against the USD during those seven days, the company will receive more INR for their USD exports and pay less INR for their USD imports.
