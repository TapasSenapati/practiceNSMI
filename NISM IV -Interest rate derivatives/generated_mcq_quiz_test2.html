    "explanation": "Explanation: Since the&nbsp;expiry price (?21.70)&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;strike price (?21.50), the call option is&nbsp;in-the-money&nbsp;and will be exercised. Lets calculate Gross Payoff from Exercise Gross Payoff&nbsp;= Expiry Price – Strike Price 21.70 − 21.50 =&nbsp; Rs. 0.20&nbsp; To get the net pay-off, we subtract the premium paid of Rs. 0.20 Net Payoff&nbsp;= Gross Payoff – Premium 0.20 − 0.20&nbsp; =&nbsp; 0 &nbsp;"

      "Nil impact",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Reinvestment risk is the risk that future cash flows (like interest payments from a bond) will be reinvested at a lower interest rate than the original bond yield. This doesn't impact the bond's value immediately, but over time, as coupons are reinvested at potentially lower rates, the total return can be reduced — hence the effect is slow over a period of time. &nbsp;"

Put Option (Strike 150) Since spot price &lt; strike price, the put is in the money. Payoff = 150 - 149.50 = Rs 0.50 Total Payoff = 0 (call) + 0.50 (put) = Rs. 0.50 The total cost is the premiums paid which are 0.30 and 0.20 = Rs 0.50 Net P/L = Payoff - Premiums = 0.50 - 0.50 = 0.00 &nbsp;"

      "Steepening shift",
      "Parallel shift"

Both have the same underlying but different maturities. Therefore a&nbsp;calendar spread&nbsp;in futures involves: Opposite market sides&nbsp;(one long and one short) Same underlying asset Different expiry months None of the above options match the correct definition of a Calendar Spread. &nbsp;"

      "Interest rate risk",
      "Commodity risk"

    "explanation": "Explanation: For banks, the predominant risk is typically interest rate risk, because&nbsp;Banks borrow short-term (e.g., through deposits) and lend long-term (e.g., through loans and mortgages) This mismatch in maturities makes them highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, affecting both net interest income and the economic value of their assets and liabilities. &nbsp;"

      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Hedgers using Interest Rate Derivatives (IRDs) face limitations mainly due to: 1.&nbsp;Standardised Contracts:&nbsp;Exchange-traded IRDs (like interest rate futures) are standardized in terms of contract size, maturity, and underlying instruments.&nbsp;This standardization may not perfectly match the hedger's actual exposure, leading to basis risk. 2.&nbsp;Non-availability on All Types of Underlying Instruments:&nbsp;IRDs may not be available for all kinds of debt instruments (like specific corporate bonds or loans).&nbsp;This limits the effectiveness of hedging for certain portfolios or instruments. &nbsp;"

      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: If you expect interest rates to rise in the future, bond prices will typically fall because bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship.
