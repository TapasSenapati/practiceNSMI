    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The trader has two views: 1.&nbsp;Bullish on USDINR → Expects the USD to appreciate against INR. 2.&nbsp;Decrease in volatility → Prefers a strategy that benefits from lower option premiums due to reduced implied volatility. Why Short Put Option? A put option gives the buyer the right to sell at a fixed strike price. If the trader is bullish, they expect USDINR to rise, making put options less valuable or even expire worthless. By selling (shorting) a put, the trader collects the premium and profits if the price stays the same or increases. Additionally, a decrease in volatility reduces the value of the put option, helping the seller (because lower volatility reduces option premiums). Why Not the Other Options? -&nbsp;Long Call Option – Correct for a bullish view, but it loses value if volatility drops (which contradicts the trader’s second expectation). -&nbsp;Short Call Option – A short call is a bearish strategy, which goes against the bullish view. -&nbsp;Long Put Option – A long put is bearish, opposite to the trader's bullish view. Thus, the best strategy is Short Put, as it aligns with both the bullish outlook and expectation of lower volatility. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: A&nbsp;significantly better than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI)&nbsp;from the UK means&nbsp;inflation is higher than expected. This typically leads to: Expectations of tighter monetary policy&nbsp;by the Bank of England (BoE), such as interest rate hikes.

    "explanation": "Explanation: This Indian company pays for imports first, requiring INR to buy GBP. A week later, it receives GBP from exports, which it converts back to INR. The risk arises if INR appreciates during this week, meaning the incoming GBP from exports will convert into fewer rupees, causing a net loss against the earlier fixed import cost. Lets assume the GBPINR rate is 80 and the export and imports are 1000 GBP The company makes payments for imports at GBPINR 80 x 1000 = Rs. 80,000&nbsp; After a week if INR appreciates, the GBPINR rate becomes say 78. So it will receive for its exports 78 x 1000 = Rs. 78000 So it will receive less amount than it has paid for imports. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: The rate will be higher as the difference in interest rates will be added to the future price. We can also calculate this as under : Interest Rate Parity formula : Forward&nbsp;Rate = Spot&nbsp;Rate x [(1+Domestic Interest Rate) / (1+Foreign Interest Rate) = 91.60 x [(1+0.07) / (1+0.02)] = 91.60 x (1.07/1.02) = 91.60 x 1.049 = 96.09 Thus, the 1-year forward rate of GBPINR = Rs 96.09"

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A stop-loss BUY order activates when the market price reaches the trigger price, turning into a limit order to buy at or below the limit price. The trigger price is set at a level where the trader wants to buy to limit losses (e.g., in a short position). The limit price is the maximum price the trader is willing to pay, typically set slightly higher than the trigger price. Thus, the trigger price is less than the limit price to ensure the order can execute within an acceptable range. For eg. If for stop-loss&nbsp;buy order, the trigger is Rs 64.0025, the limit price is Rs 64.2575, then this order is&nbsp;released into the system once the market price reaches or exceeds Rs 64.0025.
