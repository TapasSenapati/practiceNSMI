However, option contracts do not have linear payoffs as the buyers and sellers have different obligations and risk factors. The buyer of an option has limited risk (premium which he pays) but can earn unlimited profits whereas the seller of the option has unlimited risk but can earn only limited profits (premium which he receives).
