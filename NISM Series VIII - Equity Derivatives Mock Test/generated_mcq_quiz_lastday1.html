If the stock rises significantly (e.g., Rs. 250, 300...), the trader still has to sell at Rs. 200, incurring a loss that increases as the stock price increases. There is no upper limit to how high the stock price can go. Since the trader must sell at Rs. 200, his loss is theoretically unlimited, reduced by the premium received (Rs. 12). &nbsp;"

The cost-of-carry effect—since put options involve selling the underlying asset, the higher interest rate increases the opportunity cost of holding short positions, thus lowering demand for puts. Call options, on the other hand, tend to see an increase in premiums when interest rates rise due to lower borrowing costs for leveraged equity investments. &nbsp;"
