The reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage is done when the futures contract are lower than the cash market price.&nbsp; For eg. Reliance Industries Ltd. is trading at Rs 2050 in the cash market and Rs. 2000 in futures market. The arbitrageur will sell in the cash market at Rs 2050 and buy in the future market at Rs 2000, thus making a profit of Rs 50 (less expenses). The arbitrageur should have the stock to deliver in the cash market, which will be bought back at the time of reversing the position. If stock is not available, arbitrageur needs to borrow the stock to implement the arbitrage. Therefore, existence of a facility for lending and borrowing securities is required for smooth execution Reverse cash-and-carry arbitrage. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: A Short Straddle strategy involves selling a Call and a Put option at the same strike price (usually at-the-money). It profits when the price remains stable and volatility is low, because both options lose value as time passes (time decay works in the seller’s favor). The trader earns the total premium received from selling both options. However, it carries high risk if the market moves sharply in either direction. Hence, when volatility is expected to remain very low, the most suitable strategy is a Short Straddle. &nbsp;"

The maximum profit to be gained using this strategy is equal to the credit received when initiating the trade.
