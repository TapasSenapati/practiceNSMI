      "Simultaneously sells a call option and a put option with different strike prices, typically out-of-the-money (OTM)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A short strangle strategy involves: -&nbsp;Selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) call -&nbsp;Selling an out-of-the-money (OTM) put Both options have the same expiration date but different strike prices. The trader profits if the underlying asset stays within the range defined by these strike prices, as both options expire worthless. It's a neutral strategy used to earn premium from time decay, ideal when the trader expects low volatility. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: Quantity freeze is a mechanism used by exchanges to control excessive order sizes, particularly in volatile market conditions. It sets a maximum limit on the number of contracts or shares that can be traded in a single order or within a specific timeframe by a single trading member or trading ID. This helps to prevent large, disruptive orders from causing market instability. &nbsp;"

      "Insufficient data"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: For a call option, the strike price is the price at which the holder can buy the underlying asset. When the strike price increases, the likelihood of the option ending in-the-money decreases, and therefore: -&nbsp;The intrinsic value becomes lower (or zero) -&nbsp;The overall premium (price of the option) decreases. &nbsp;"

      "Annuity",
      "Coupon Bond"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Zero Coupon Bond: The return (yield) is&nbsp;fixed and known in advance&nbsp;because it is purchased at a discount and redeemed at face value. There is no intermediate cash flows. The difference represents the pre-determined return. Other Instruments: -&nbsp;Consols (Perpetual Bonds): No maturity date, so return depends on future interest rates. -&nbsp;Annuity: Payments are fixed, but the true return depends on lifespan/duration. -&nbsp;Coupon Bond: Return varies if sold before maturity (due to changing yields). Therefore, only&nbsp;zero coupon bonds&nbsp;guarantee a&nbsp;pre-computable return&nbsp;if held to maturity. &nbsp;"

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: In Reverse arbitrage with single bond interest rate futures, the arbitrageur takes advantage of a situation where the futures price is lower than the fair price (i.e., the futures are underpriced). To profit from this: -&nbsp;The arbitrageur sells the GOI bond in the spot (underlying) market -&nbsp;And buys the futures contract of the same GOI bond At expiry, the arbitrageur delivers the bond bought via futures (at a cheaper rate) and benefits from the price difference. This is the reverse of a standard arbitrage (cash-and-carry), where the futures are overpriced. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: Interest rate risk refers to the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the value of investments, especially fixed-income securities like bonds.

    "explanation": "Explanation: VaR will be slightly higher for short positions than for long positions. The reason is that the price can theoretically rise to infinity but cannot fall below zero.
