    "correct": 2,

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Each clients open position is taken separately for calculating the initial margin. Positions of two or more clients cannot be netted off against each other for calculation of initial margin. For eg - If Mr A has bought 10 contracts of Nifty and Mr B has sold 4 contracts of Nifty, then the broker has to pay the initial margin on 14 contracts and not 6 contracts."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Arbitrage means the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the price. It is a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets. For example- If SBI is quoted on NSE at Rs 200 and on BSE there is a buyer at Rs 203, then the arbitrageur will buy on NSE and sell on BSE and Rs 3 (less brokerage etc.) will be is profit. Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies; it provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Calendar spread means an options or futures spread established by simultaneously entering a long and short position on the same underlying asset but with different delivery months. In the above question, lets assume a trader has gone long in index options in current month and short in index options in third month. Incase he does not close his position by the end of current month, his current month option will expire and the third month option contract will become an open position as there is no opposite option contract in his account."

    "explanation": "Explanation: Broker-Members are not allowed to be part of the Clearing Council of the Clearing Corporation in the derivatives segment. This rule exists to avoid conflicts of interest — since broker-members are market participants, their inclusion in the council could influence decisions affecting trading and settlement fairness. Therefore, only independent members and representatives of the exchange/clearing corporation (not trading brokers) can serve on the Clearing Council. &nbsp;"
