However, a 1–2 day gap between receiving USD and paying for imports introduces short-term risk. If the INR appreciates during this period, the USD converts to fewer INR, potentially causing a shortfall for import payments. The company receives dollars (USD) from exports and uses them to pay for imports a couple of days later. If the rupee becomes stronger (for example, USD/INR goes from 83 to 82.50), each dollar is now worth fewer rupees. So, if the company needs to convert some of those dollars into rupees (to pay for things like taxes, shipping, or other local costs), it will get less rupees than expected. This could cause a small shortage in the money needed for those expenses. Even if the main import payment is in dollars, some side costs might be in rupees, and that’s where a risk can happen. &nbsp;"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Basis risk is the potential risk that arises from mismatches in a hedged position. Basis risk occurs when a hedge is imperfect, so that losses are not exactly offset by the hedge. Basis risk can arise from standardization of derivatives contract for amount and expiry date. (For example, you need to hedge an exposure of USD 9500, which requires the futures contracts of 9500 / 1000 = 9.5. Since we can buy or sell only in integral multiples, we need to buy or sell either nine or ten contracts. The former leads to under-hedging and the latter, to over-hedging. Second, the derivatives contract expires on every Friday day of the week or two working days prior to the last business day of the expiry month. If the exposure to be hedged has maturity of some other day in the month, there will be mismatch in the maturity. The discrepancy in the amount and maturity of exposure and the derivatives contract leaves a residual risk called basis risk) &nbsp;"
