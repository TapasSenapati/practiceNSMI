      "Sell a call with lower strike and sell a put with higher strike"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A&nbsp;bullish vertical spread&nbsp;(also called a&nbsp;bull call spread) is constructed by: 1.&nbsp;Buying a call option&nbsp;with a&nbsp;lower strike price&nbsp;(more likely to be in-the-money). 2.&nbsp;Selling a call option&nbsp;with a&nbsp;higher strike price&nbsp;(offsets cost but caps upside). This is bullish because it will result in profits if the underlying asset price&nbsp;rises moderately. However the&nbsp;sold call&nbsp;reduces the net premium paid but limits maximum profit. &nbsp;"

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The base price for the trading day is 100, and the price range is 1%. This means the price can move 1% up or down from the base price. 1% of 100 = 1. Therefore, the price range for the opening price can be between: Lower limit: 100 - 1 = 99 Upper limit: 100 + 1 = 101 So, the opening price for the trading day should be between 99 and 101. &nbsp;"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Treasury bill futures contracts are quoted using the discount yield method, and the price is calculated as: Quoted&nbsp;Price = 100 − Discount&nbsp;Yield This means that if the discount yield on a T-bill is 5%, the futures contract would be quoted at 100 – 5 = 95.00. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: An inter-bond spread in futures refers to a strategy where a trader takes opposite positions (buy one, sell another) in two different bond futures contracts (i.e., different underlyings) that have the same expiry month. Key characteristics of inter-bond spread: Different market sides: One long (buy), one short (sell) Different underlyings: Two different bonds Same expiry month: Both contracts expire in the same month This spread is used to profit from the relative movement between the prices of the two bond futures. &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: Accrued interest is the interest accrual at coupon rate from the previous coupon date to the settlement date of the trade.&nbsp;The settlement date of the secondary market trade falls between two coupon date, which we will designate as previous coupon date and next coupon date. Between previous coupon date and settlement date, it is the seller that owns the bond and&nbsp;therefore is entitled to receive the interest accrual for this period. Similarly, it is buyer that owns the bond between settlement date and next coupon date and therefore he is entitled to the interest accrual only for this period. However, the issuer does not keep track of who owns the bonds for which period during the coupon period. Whosoever owns the bond on next coupon date, he gets the coupon for the full period. Accordingly, the buyer gets the coupon for the full period, which means that the seller is deprived of his entitlement. To make the trade fair to both parties, buyers computes the interest accrual from previous coupon date to settlement date, and pays to the seller as an add-on amount of “accrued interest” at the time of settlement, and gets it reimbursed on the next coupon date. &nbsp;"
