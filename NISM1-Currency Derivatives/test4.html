The price quoted by a market maker is valid for certain quantity of the currency pair and it may vary if the amount for which quote is sought is higher. Spread is an important parameter to note while assessing market liquidity, efficiency of market maker and market direction. Clearly, a narrow spread indicates a higher liquidity and higher efficiency of the market maker. In USDINR spot market, the spreads are wide at the time of opening and gradually start narrowing as the market discovers the price.
