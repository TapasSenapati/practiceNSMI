(Statement 1 is TRUE) Conversely, if the strike price increases, the call option becomes less attractive, reducing the premium. (Statement 2 is FALSE) Put Option Premium Behavior: A Put Option gives the buyer the right to sell an asset at a specified strike price before expiration. If the strike price increases, the put option becomes more valuable since the asset can be sold at a higher price, leading to a higher premium. (Statement 3 is TRUE) If the strike price decreases, the put option becomes less attractive, leading to a lower premium.

Increases the cost of trading -&nbsp;More margin requirements mean higher capital tied up, increasing the opportunity cost and overall trading cost. Reduces the volumes for a given level of risk capital in the economy -&nbsp;Since capital is not optimally used, the same amount of risk capital supports fewer trades, reducing trading volumes. &nbsp;"
