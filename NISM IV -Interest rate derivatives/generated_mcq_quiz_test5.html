      "Current accounting standards require all derivative instruments to be recorded at their book value"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Under current accounting standards, the treatment of derivatives includes the following key principle- &nbsp;Recognition on the Balance Sheet: -&nbsp;All derivative contracts, whether settled or unsettled, must be recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. -&nbsp;They are measured at fair value, not book value or zero &nbsp;"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which of the following can only be done by a Trading member?",

      "Both of the above",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: In the structure of exchange-traded markets, the roles are divided between Trading Members and Clearing Members: 1.&nbsp;Trading Member&nbsp; -&nbsp;Authorized to execute trades on the exchange. -&nbsp;Cannot clear or settle trades unless they are also a Clearing Member. 2.&nbsp;Clearing Member -&nbsp;Responsible for clearing and settlement of trades (their own or on behalf of trading members). &nbsp;"

    "options": [
      "80%",
      "85%",
      "90%",
      "95%"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: As a risk reduction measure, according to SEBI and exchange guidelines, all unexecuted orders are required to be cancelled automatically if a stock broker breaches 90% of the collateral utilisation level. This is done to prevent excessive risk exposure and ensure that brokers do not place orders beyond their risk-taking capacity. &nbsp;"
  },
  {
    "text": "What is a feature of Contract-level minimum margin?",
    "options": [
      "It will be same for all treasury bill futures and government securities futures",
      "It will be different for treasury bill and Government bond futures but same for all government bond futures",
      "It will be different for each treasury bill and for each government bond futures",
      "There are no margins for treasury bills and other Government Securities"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Treasury bill futures and government bond futures have different risk profiles, mainly due to differences in maturity and volatility. Therefore, their minimum margin requirements will differ. Within the category of government bond futures, the exchange may have standardized margin requirements or may vary them based on the specific underlying security, however the most common practice is to have a standardized margin for all government bond futures. &nbsp;"

    "text": "What entity acts as the guarantor for transactions in the exchange-traded derivatives market?",
    "options": [
      "The Trading Member",
      "The Clearing Member",
      "The Clearing Bank",
      "None of these"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The Clearing Corporation provides a trade guarantee&nbsp;by becoming the central counterparty (CCP)&nbsp;to both the buyer and seller. This happens through a process called Novation, where the CCP steps in and replaces the original contract — becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. This ensures smooth settlement and reduces counterparty risk. &nbsp;"

    "text": "If an investor has the choice between two bonds issued by the same entity, maturing at the same time, but paying different coupon amounts, which should they select?",
    "options": [

      "The investor can select any as the returns will be the same",
      "The decision for judging the cheapness of a bond cannot be taken based on price"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: When choosing between two bonds issued by the same entity with the same maturity but different coupon amounts, the investor should consider the yield to maturity (YTM) rather than just the market price. The bond with the higher YTM offers better returns, accounting for both coupon payments and price differences. Market price alone doesn’t determine which bond is \"cheaper\" or more attractive, as it ignores the impact of coupons and yield on total returns. &nbsp;"
  },
  {
    "text": "Which of these financial instruments involve periodic principal repayments prior to the final maturity date?",
    "options": [
      "Zero Coupon Bond",
      "Coupon Bond",

      "Staggered maturities"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Staggered maturities or more commonly referred to as an amortizing bond or a bond with an amortization schedule. These bonds involve periodic payments that include both interest and a portion of the principal.&nbsp; This means the principal balance gradually decreases over time. &nbsp;"

      "Both of the above",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: For exchange-traded interest rate option contracts in India, the premium (i.e., the price paid by the buyer to the seller of the option) is settled in cash.&nbsp;This is a standard practice for exchange-traded derivatives, ensuring efficient and transparent settlement. No physical delivery or adjustment to liquid assets is involved in premium settlement. &nbsp;"

    "options": [
      "Strike Price",
      "Market Price",
      "Agreed Price",
      "Premium"
    ],
    "correct": 3,

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The Broker accepts orders from the client and sends the same to the Exchange after performing the risk management checks.

      "7.5%",
      "6%",
      "Treasury bills are issued as Zero-coupon instruments",
      "The coupon varies from issue to issue"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Treasury bills (T-bills) issued by the Government of India do not pay a coupon rate or periodic interest payments. Instead, they are zero-coupon instruments. T-bills are sold at a price lower than their face value (also known as the par value or maturity value). &nbsp;On the maturity date, the investor receives the full face value of the T-bill. &nbsp;The investor's profit is the difference between the face value they receive at maturity and the discounted price they paid at the time of purchase. This difference effectively represents the interest earned. &nbsp;"

      "There will be no change in the price of a put option",
      "It cannot be determined"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: When volatility of the underlying asset increases, the premium of both call and put options increases This is because: -&nbsp;Higher volatility increases the probability that the option will end up in the money before expiry. -&nbsp;Therefore, the potential for profit is higher, which makes the option more valuable. &nbsp;"

      "Make loss of Rs. 1",
      "No profit no loss",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: When a person goes short in a futures contract, they are essentially betting that the price of the underlying asset will fall. In this case, the person shorts the futures contract at Rs. 100.&nbsp;At the time of expiry, the underlying price is Rs. 101. Since the person is short, they will need to buy back the contract at the prevailing market price of Rs. 101 to close their position. As they sold at Rs. 100 and bought back at Rs. 101, they will incur a loss of Rs. 1 per unit of the underlying asset. &nbsp;"

      "Out of the money",
      "At the money",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: An option is considered \"Out of the Money\" if, on exercising it, the option buyer gets a negative cash flow (i.e., they would incur a loss). For a call option, it is out of the money when the strike price is higher than the current market price of the underlying asset. For a put option, it is out of the money when the strike price is lower than the current market price of the underlying asset. In this case, exercising the option would result in a negative cash flow, meaning the option holder would lose money. &nbsp;"
