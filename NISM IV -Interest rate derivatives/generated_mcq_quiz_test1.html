    "explanation": "Explanation: If you expect that 3-month interest rates will increase in one month, here's how you would trade: -&nbsp;Interest rates rise → The price of instruments sensitive to interest rates (like bonds) falls. -&nbsp;The 1-month contract will be closer to its expiry and will reflect the immediate impact of the expected rate change. Since you expect the 3-month rate to rise in one month, selling a contract expiring in 1 month will capture the immediate market reaction to this interest rate change. By doing so, you are taking a short position (since interest rates are expected to rise, bond prices will fall, and you'll profit from this move). &nbsp;"

Call Option Payoff (short position): Mr. Guru&nbsp;sold&nbsp;a Rs. 55 strike&nbsp;call option, and the bond ends at Rs. 55.50.&nbsp; So the&nbsp;buyer&nbsp;of the call will&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;it (since it's in-the-money), and Mr. Guru has to sell the bond at Rs. 55. Loss on call = Rs. 55.50 − Rs. 55 = Rs. 0.50 (Since he's short the call, he&nbsp;loses&nbsp;Rs. 0.50) 3. Premium Received: Mr. Guru collected Rs. 0.10 for selling the call. Total Net Payoff :&nbsp;Bond&nbsp;gain − Call&nbsp;loss + Premium&nbsp;received = 1.00 − 0.50 +0.10 = Rs.0.60 &nbsp;"
