    "options": [
      "the buyer does not set any price limit",
      "the buyer’s specified price is invisible to the market",
      "the buyer specifies a price below the prevailing market price",
      "the buyer specifies a price above the prevailing market price"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: In a limit buy order, the investor sets a maximum price they're willing to pay for a stock. The order is executed only if the market price falls to or below the specified limit price. Since the limit price is the maximum they're willing to pay, it's typically set below the current market price, waiting for the price to drop to that level or lower. For eg - If the current market price = Rs. 100&nbsp;and you place a limit buy order at Rs. 95,&nbsp; the order will execute only if the price drops to Rs. 95 or below &nbsp;"

      "Increase",
      "Decrease",
      "Level out",
      "Go towards becoming zero"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Delta measures the sensitivity of an option’s price to a change in the price of the underlying asset. For a call option, delta ranges from 0 to 1, and for a put option, it ranges from 0 to -1. As an option becomes more in-the-money (i.e., the stock price moves further above the strike price for a call or below it for a put), its delta approaches 1 (for calls) or -1 (for puts) in absolute terms. This is because the option behaves more like the underlying asset, with a higher probability of being exercised. Thus, the absolute value of delta increases. &nbsp;"

    "options": [
      "Cost of carry",
      "Cost of acquisition",

    "explanation": "Explanation: Cost of carry refers to the total cost of holding an underlying asset over a period of time until a future date. It includes: -&nbsp;Interest cost (if funds are borrowed to buy the asset) -&nbsp;Storage or warehousing costs (for commodities) -&nbsp;Dividends or other benefits foregone &nbsp;"

      "Individual Securities contracts",
      "Copper contracts",
      "Index futures contracts"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Index futures cannot be used to acquire the underlying asset because stock market indices are not tangible assets and cannot be delivered. They are mathematical representations of a group of securities. Therefore, index futures are always cash-settled and cannot be used to acquire the underlying asset. &nbsp;"

      "May",
      "June",
      "July"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: When comparing call options with the same strike price but different expiration dates: Longer the time to expiry, higher the premium — because there's more time for the option to become profitable.&nbsp;Therefore, among May, June and July series - May&nbsp;has the shortest time to expiry, so it will have the lowest premium. July will have the highest premium, assuming all other factors (strike price, volatility, interest rates) are constant. &nbsp;"

      "Purchase of an at-the-money put and sale of an out-of-the-money put, both with identical expiries"

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A Bullish Vertical Spread is a strategy used when a trader expects a moderate rise in the price of the underlying asset while limiting both potential risk and reward It can be constructed with : 1.&nbsp;Buy a call option at a lower strike (at-the-money) 2.&nbsp;Sell a call option at a higher strike (out-of-the-money) 3.&nbsp;Both options have the same expiry date This limits both profit and loss compared to a plain long call. &nbsp;"

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Forward contracts are over-the-counter (OTC) agreements between two parties, and the terms, including the price, quantity, and delivery date, are customized and agreed upon by both the buyer and seller.

      "Similar to that of a futures contract",
      "Similar to that of a corporate debenture",
      "Linear",
      "Non-linear"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The risk–return profile of an options contract is non-linear because the payoff changes disproportionately with movements in the underlying asset’s price. This happens due to the asymmetric payoff structure — The buyer's potential loss is limited to the premium paid, while the potential gain can be substantial. Conversely, the seller's potential gain is limited to the premium received, but the potential loss can be significant. This non-linearity is a key characteristic of options. &nbsp;"

      "Futures contracts are traded only over-the-counter (OTC)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Futures contracts are standardized agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future date, and they are traded exclusively on organized exchanges (like NSE, BSE etc.). Forward contracts, on the other hand, are customized and traded over-the-counter (OTC). Hence, futures cannot be traded OTC, and they are not the same as forwards. &nbsp;"

      "It can be closed by taking a short position in a call option with the same strike price and expiration date"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A long position in a put option can be closed out by taking a short position in a put option with the same exercise date and exercise price. This is because taking a short position in the same put option (with the same strike price and expiration date) would offset the existing long position, effectively closing it out. All other combinations (like using call options or different strikes/dates) will not close the position. &nbsp;"

Selling price = 2400 Buying price = 2550 Difference = 2550 - 2400 = 150 (loss per unit) Contract multiplier = 60 Loss = 150 x 60 = 9000 So, the correct answer is: A loss of rupees 9,000 &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: A seller of a put option hopes the stock price goes up or stays the same. They earn a premium and profit if the option expires worthless, which happens if the stock price is above the strike price. If the stock price drops, they might lose money by having to buy the stock at a higher price than the market. So, they want the price to rise or not change. A put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified strike price. The seller (writer) of the put option is obligated to buy the asset if the buyer exercises the option. So, the seller of a put option benefits when: The price of the underlying increases (the option becomes worthless, and the seller keeps the premium). The price remains the same or above the strike price (again, the option is not exercised). &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: Delta measures how much the price of an option is expected to change for a ?1 change in the price of the underlying asset. Here, Delta = 0.60 and the underlying price increases by Rs.5 So, the option value will increase by: Change&nbsp;in&nbsp;Option&nbsp;Value = Delta × Change&nbsp;in&nbsp;Underlying&nbsp;Price = 0.60 x 5 = Rs. 3 &nbsp;"

It represents the cost of executing a transaction compared to the ideal (mid-market) price — essentially, how much the price moves because of your own trade. A lower impact cost indicates higher liquidity, meaning you can buy or sell large quantities without significantly affecting the price. &nbsp;"

Here's how it works: You buy a call option and a put option on the same stock. Both options have the same strike price and expiration date.

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Initial margin is the minimum amount that must be deposited to cover potential losses arising from price movements in open positions.

Intrinsic Value is the profit you could realize if you exercised the option immediately. It can never be negative, so it's always either zero or a positive amount. An option is considered Out-of-the-money when exercising it would not result in a profit for the holder at the current market price.

    "explanation": "Explanation: For a put option, as the strike price increases (or is \"taken up\"), the intrinsic value (the amount by which the option is in-the-money) also increases. This is because a higher strike price gives the holder of the put option the right to sell the underlying asset at a higher price, making the option more valuable. For eg : Let's say you have a put option to sell a stock with a strike price of Rs. 100, and the current market price is Rs. 90. Intrinsic value = Strike price - Market price = Rs. 100 - Rs. 90 = Rs. 10 If the strike price increases to Rs. 105, Intrinsic value = Rs. 105 - Rs. 90 = Rs. 15 So, as the strike price goes up, the intrinsic value of the put option also goes up, from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15. &nbsp;"
