Derivative transactions are considered speculative business losses, and as such, they can only be set off against other business income or speculative business income in the same financial year. Salary income is not considered part of business income and therefore cannot be offset against speculative losses (such as from derivatives). &nbsp;"

      "None of the above"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Basis risk arises due to a mismatch between the hedged asset and the futures contract used for hedging. Two key reasons are: -&nbsp;Futures contract amount is standardized – The contract size may not exactly match the quantity of the asset being hedged. -&nbsp;Futures expiry date is standardized – The contract may not mature at the exact time when the hedge is needed. These standardizations create a risk that the futures price and the spot price will not move perfectly in sync, leading to basis risk. &nbsp;"

      "Directly for Put option only",
      "Directly for Call option only"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The time value of an option is the portion of the option's premium that is attributed to the time remaining until expiration. Longer time to expiration - Higher is the time value As the expiration date approaches, the time value decays, eventually becoming zero at expiry. This relationship holds true for both Call and Put options. &nbsp;"

      "There is a loss of Rs 2",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: Mr. Raj&nbsp;goes long in a futures contract at Rs 58. On expiry, the underlying price is Rs 56. Since futures are marked-to-market and settled at the underlying price on expiry: Loss = 58 - 56 = Rs 2 &nbsp;"

    "explanation": "Explanation: In an inverted curve, there is demand for short-term money (i.e. working capital) and not for long-term money (i.e. capital expenditure). So the rate is higher at first and then falls.&nbsp; This means that borrowers are not going for capital expenditure possibly because they expect no economic growth in the future, which explains why inverted yield curve may indicate recession in near future."
