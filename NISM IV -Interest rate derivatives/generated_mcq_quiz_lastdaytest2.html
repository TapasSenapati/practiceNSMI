Fractions (like Rs. 1 lakh or Rs. 5 lakhs)&nbsp;are&nbsp;not allowed—only exact multiples of Rs. 2 lakhs are tradable.

    "explanation": "Explanation: The primary role of derivatives is risk management.

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Explanation: A bullish vertical spread using puts is also known as a bull put spread. Here's how it works: The trader sells a put option with a higher strike price (more expensive), And buys a put option with a lower strike price (cheaper), Both options have the same expiration date. This results in a net credit (you receive premium), and you profit when the underlying asset stays above the higher strike (i.e., you're bullish). &nbsp;"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Explanation: The Modified Duration of a bond is a measure of its price sensitivity to interest rate changes. It is derived from the Macaulay duration, adjusted for the bond's yield to maturity. As the coupon increases, the bond's cash flows become more front-loaded (larger payments are received earlier).&nbsp;With higher coupons, the bond's price becomes less sensitive to interest rate changes because the investor is receiving a larger portion of the bond's value in the form of early coupon payments.&nbsp;This leads to a decrease in Modified Duration, as the bond’s price is less affected by changes in interest rates. &nbsp;"
