Further, an eligible transaction in respect of trading in derivatives referred to in clause (ac) of section 2 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (42 of 1956) carried out in a recognised stock exchange shall not be deemed to be a speculative transaction. Thus, income or loss from dealing in exchange traded currency derivatives shall be deemed as normal business income (non-speculative business) even though delivery is not effected in such transactions. &nbsp;"
