For a put option which is In-the-money, the intrinsic value is the excess of Strike price (X) over the spot price (S). Thus, the intrinsic value of put option can be calculated as X-S, with a minimum value possible as zero. For eg – If strike price is 100 and spot price is 90, the intrinsic value is 10 Likewise, if the strike price is 95, the intrinsic value will be about 5. Other Explanation : A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset at the strike price. When the strike price decreases, the difference between the strike price and market price reduces, lowering the intrinsic value of the put option. If the strike price falls below the market price, the put option becomes out of the money (OTM) and its intrinsic value becomes zero. Thus, as the strike price decreases, the intrinsic value of the put option goes down. &nbsp;"
