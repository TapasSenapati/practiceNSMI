The binomial option pricing model values options using an iterative approach utilizing multiple periods to value options. The binomial option pricing model was developed by William Sharpe in 1978. It has proved over time to be the most flexible, intuitive and popular approach to option pricing. The binomial model represents the price evolution of the option’s underlying asset as the binomial tree of all possible prices at equally-spaced time steps from today under the assumption that at each step, the price can only move up and down at fixed rates and with respective simulated probabilities. This is a very accurate model as it is iterative, but also very lengthy and time consuming. &nbsp;"
